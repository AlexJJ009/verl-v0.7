# Active Plan Index

Last organized: 2026-05-20.

This directory should contain only plans that still need decisions, reruns, or
follow-up experiments. Completed, superseded, or negative-result plans should
live in `../completed/`.

## Active

| Plan | Status | Why it remains active |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wdl_group_advantage_is_goal.md` | Active implementation contract | New method revision: group advantages + all-correct positive-SFT fallback + explicit mixed-policy old/current IS for joint rollout/joint training, with `norm_adv_by_std_in_grpo=false`, no `rollout_is_weights`, no KL penalty, no length normalization, no `beta`, and a required complete Meituan four-layer launch family. |
| `wdl_sft_is.md` | Active, but historical sections are stale | The post-fix rerun matrix is still open. Pre-fix 1A/1B/1C results remain useful history, but should not be treated as spec-correct current runs. |
| `ablation_single_model.md` | Active / partially completed | The SFT-init ablation has useful results, but the post-fix rerun matrix is incomplete and several rows remain not started. |

## Archived During This Cleanup

| Archived plan | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `../completed/on_policy_wdl_sft_v1.md` | Superseded by `wdl_sft_is.md` on 2026-04-19. |
| `../completed/dual_submodel_rollout_wdl_sft.md` | Implementation completed and smoke-passed, but real 3A training produced a method-level negative result. |
| `../completed/dual_submodel_rollout_wdl_sft_goal.md` | Implementation contract preserved for traceability; no longer an active goal. |
| `../completed/dual_submodel_rollout_wdl_sft_status.md` | Final implementation/smoke/failure status preserved with the archived plan. |
| `../completed/dual_submodel_rollout_wdl_sft_3a_failure_analysis.md` | Detailed gradient, loss, and distribution analysis for the 3A negative result. |
